                Programming is a cardinal element in the computer science stream. 
                The digital world is driven by computer programs. 
                The heart of the programs is the code. The computer people are very enthusiastic about programming. 
                This aura also attracts people from other streams to jam the RAM. 
                For this reason, some of the students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Assam Engineering College (AEC) came up with the idea of a clubâ€”called the Coding Club of AEC. 
                From time to time, this club has been organizing various events. 
                The most notable one is the annual coding competition during Pyrokinesis. 
                Taking this opportunity, I applaud the efforts of the club committee members and also the other members for nurturing the club to sustain. 
                As Professor in-charge, I wish the Coding Club of AEC may attain an envious height of success soon.
